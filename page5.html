    <h2>The Message of the Story</h2>
    <p>The lesson from this story is that even though the rabbit was fast, his overconfidence and lack of perseverance caused him to lose. The turtle, on the other hand, succeeded with steady determination. It teaches us that with hope and persistence, we can achieve success, no matter the odds.</p>
