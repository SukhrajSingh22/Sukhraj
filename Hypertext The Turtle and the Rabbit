    <h2>Let the Race Begin</h2>
    <p>The race began, and the rabbit dashed ahead, while the turtle kept moving steadily with small, careful steps.</p>
    <h2>The Rabbit Gets Overconfident</h2>
    <p>When the rabbit saw that he was way ahead of the turtle, he took a nap under a tree, overconfident that he was sure to win. Meanwhile, the turtle continued at his steady pace.</p>

    <h2>The Message of the Story</h2>
    <p>The lesson from this story is that even though the rabbit was fast, his overconfidence and lack of perseverance caused him to lose. The turtle, on the other hand, succeeded with steady determination. It teaches us that with hope and persistence, we can achieve success, no matter the odds.</p>
