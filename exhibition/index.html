        <h2>Curatorial Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Each of these artworks share a common theme: they explore how technology and the internet shape human emotions, perception, and interaction.  
            The digital world has redefined how we experience and engage with art, just as it has reshaped the way we connect with others in daily life.  
            This exhibition presents three net art pieces that challenge our perceptions of reality, poetry, and emotional emptiness in the vastness of the internet.

            Maja Bajevic’s piece examines the illusion of the Hollywood dream and the hidden consequences behind its glamorous façade.  
            Nick Mauss and Ken Okiishi’s work highlights the intricacies of poetry and its deep connection with music and human expression.  
            Wilfredo Prieto's piece reflects on the digital world's paradox—how it connects billions yet sometimes makes us feel more alone than ever.  
            Together, these works illustrate how digital art serves as both a mirror and a medium for emotional and intellectual exploration.
